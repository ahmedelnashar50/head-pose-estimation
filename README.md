# ðŸ§© Head Pose Estimation (MediaPipe + SVR)

This repository provides a solution for estimating **head pose angles** (pitch, yaw, roll) from human face images and videos.  

The system combines:  
- **MediaPipe FaceMesh** â†’ to extract dense 3D facial landmarks  
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** â†’ to predict head orientation from the landmarks  

The implementation supports **both API-based and web-based interfaces**, making it flexible for integration into larger applications or direct usage.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

This project is based on the **AFLW2000-3D dataset**, which contains **2000 face images** annotated with 3D landmarks and pose angles.  

- **Source:** [AFLW2000-3D on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Annotations:** Pitch, yaw, and roll angles + 68 3D landmarks  
- **Usage:** Suitable for head pose estimation, facial landmark detection, and related tasks

## ðŸš€ Running the Applications

### Option 1: Flask (with HTML upload form)
```bash
python app.py
```
Visit â†’ http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### Option 2: FastAPI (interactive API docs)
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## ðŸ§  Model Workflow

### Data Preprocessing (model.ipynb)

Extract landmarks from dataset

Align inputs for regression

### Model Training

Train SVR for each angle (pitch, yaw, roll)

### Prediction

For a new image or video â†’ extract landmarks â†’ pass to trained SVR â†’ get angles

### Visualization

Render 3D orientation axes on face in images/videos

### Model Saving

```bash
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "svr_model.pkl")
```

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

âœ… Enable real-time webcam streaming

âœ… Extend with deep learning models for improved accuracy

âœ… Provide deployment examples (Docker, Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit)
